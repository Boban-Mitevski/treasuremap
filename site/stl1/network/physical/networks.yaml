# The purpose of this file is to define all of the NetworkLinks (i.e. layer 1
# devices) and Networks (i.e. layer 3 configurations). The following is standard
# for the logical networks in NC:
#

# NetworkLinks and Networks in this file. Only the metadata name, the IP addresses and CIDRs should
# need editing.
