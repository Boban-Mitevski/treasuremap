Airship Integration
===================

Airship is a collection of components that coordinate to form means of
configuring and deploying and maintaining
a `Kubernetes <https://kubernetes.io/>`__ environment using a
declarative set of `yaml <http://yaml.org/>`__ documents.

Approach
--------

As Airship revolves around the setup and use of Kubernetes and
`Helm <https://helm.sh/>`__, practices take cues from these projects.
Since the sibling work of Airship is the `Openstack
Helm <https://github.com/openstack/openstack-helm>`__ project (now an
`Openstack <https://www.openstack.org/>`__ project) cues are also taken
from the Openstack approach.
